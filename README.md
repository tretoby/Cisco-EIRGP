# Network Topology & EIGRP Configuration Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a **small-scale network topology** using **routers, switches, and PCs**, including the implementation of **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** for efficient inter-network communication. 

The objective of this project is to **design, configure, and verify** a functional network where two separate networks can communicate using **dynamic routing protocols**. This showcases fundamental **networking skills** relevant to **IT support, network administration, and cybersecurity roles**.

## üöÄ Project Steps

### Step 1: Selecting PCs
First, I will select two PCs.

### Step 2: Selecting Switches
Next, I will add two network switches.

### Step 3: Selecting Routers
Then, I will add two routers.

### Step 4: Configuring IP Addresses and Naming Routers
I will now assign IP addresses to the PCs, set the default gateways on the routers, and rename the routers to **Milwaukee** and **Chicago**.

### Step 5: Connecting Devices
I will now connect the PCs, switches, and routers using **copper straight-through cables**.

### Step 6: Configuring the PCs
Each PC will be assigned an IP address and a default gateway.

![PC Configuration 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806d403f-cb24-44c3-aba2-8f9a75e3eaf6)

### Step 7: Configuring the Milwaukee Router
The **Milwaukee router** will be configured by setting its hostname and network interfaces.

### Step 8: Configuring the Chicago Router
Similarly, I will configure the **Chicago router** with its hostname and interfaces.

### Step 9: Verifying Connectivity
At this point, all devices should be properly connected, and the network status should indicate **green**, meaning everything is operational.

![Network Status](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3db14b1-e3ae-4653-ba68-3cf2272802b3)

### Step 10: Configuring EIGRP for Router Communication
To enable communication between the PCs across different network segments, I will configure **Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)** on both routers.

#### Step 10.1: Checking Initial Routing Table
First, I will check the routing table on the **Milwaukee router** using the `show ip route` command. At this point, only two routes should be present.

![Initial Routing Table](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f38eb07d-2d51-4fde-a73c-7c4027a2ed80)

#### Step 10.2: Configuring EIGRP on the Milwaukee Router
Now, I will enable **EIGRP** and specify the network that should be advertised to the **Chicago router**.

#### Step 10.3: Configuring EIGRP on the Chicago Router
I will now repeat the **EIGRP** configuration on the **Chicago router**.

#### Step 10.4: Verifying the Updated Routing Table
After EIGRP is successfully configured, the routing table should now display the added routes.

### Step 11: Testing Connectivity
Finally, I will use the `ping` command to verify connectivity between **PC1** and **PC2**.
